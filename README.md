 ##This assignment was focused on analyzing information from API's using Jupyter Notebooks.
 In this process, I got better at reading documentation and learned that Jupyter Notebooks will add an extra ' when you put one at the end of your f string.
 I think getting started is always the hardest part when working with API's. I have trouble figuring out how to use the keys and understanding the documentation. Once I get going it's ok.
